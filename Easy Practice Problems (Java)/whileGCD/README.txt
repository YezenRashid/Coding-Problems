Write a method named gcd that accepts two integers as parameters and returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b is the largest integer that is a factor of both a and b. The GCD of any number and 1 is 1, and the GCD of any number and 0 is that number.

Only use a while loop to solve this.

For example: gcd(24, 84) returns 12, gcd(105, 45) returns 15, and gcd(0, 8) returns 8.
