This program uses OpenCV and C++.

This program first computes the color histogram of an image and replaces the most found color in the foreground image with a background image to replicate the green screen effect. It does this by making
a histogram of buckets and replacing the color with the most votes.

The second part of this program demonstrates the use of OpenCV methods to find the edges of the background image.
